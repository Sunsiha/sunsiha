### Hallo there, I'm Sunisha 👋 <p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=sunsiha&label=Profile%20views&color=0047AB&style=plastic?" alt="sunsiha" /> </p>
I'm all about making user-friendly apps for phones. I've been doing this for 9+ years, leading teams to create practical solutions. I like keeping things simple and getting stuff done. I enjoy working in mobile and web development. Leading teams, we build apps that people find useful. I focus on making the tech side smooth and practical.
