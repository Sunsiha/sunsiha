Back when I started my career, I made a profile on GitHub with a misspelled name🤣. Now, I'm shifting my focus to create cool projects. My goal is to make my profile better😊, get more followers🤩, and connect with people🥰.
<!-- VISTAS DEL PERFIL -->
Iam basically from India. Right now am living in Heilbronn, Stuttgart. I have 9+years of experience in mobile app development. In flutter and dart, I have 4+years of experience. 
I was a native Android developer until 2019. During that period, I used to develop native iOS applications as well. So, in native iOS, I have almost 2 years of experience. Later, I got an opportunity to work on Flutter, and I am a self-taught Flutter developer. With 9+ years in mobile and web development, my focus is on user-friendly apps. Leading teams, I streamline the tech side for smooth, practical solutions that people find useful.
